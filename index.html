        uses minimal textual information and focuses on a single dynamic visual
        interaction instead, which is a 3d pentagon made of black outlines, that
        changes size and movement in response to sound. There's almost no
        instructions, which is to intentionally leave users to intuitively
        explore the relationship between sound and form. The overall UI is
        extremely minimalistic, using only black and white to contrast the
        background and guide the user to focus on different things. When the
        user is playing the music, there is a white background and the pentagon
        is specifically outlined in black, to draw the user’s attention
        immediately towards it. This whitespace amplifies the movement of the
        pentagon, making it become more dramatic and noticeable because there’s
        nothing competing with it. However, when the user stops, the background
        suddenly turns black, to mimic being sucked in. Since there is immediate
        visual contrast from the white and a pointy triangle resembling a shard
        is left in its stead, it makes the user feel more unwelcomed. This
        encourages the user to continue their experience of the pentagon.
        Similarly, in

          >Liquid entropy</a

        </article1>
        the entire page feels alive due to movement and sound, not text or
        buttons, making the aim of both websites to evoke a feeling from users.
        Since its visuals create a floating, ambient effect, the overall mood is
        dominant. However,
        <a href="https://fractalfantasy.net/#liquidentropy" target="_blank"
          >Liquid entropy</a
        >
        takes a very different approach towards whitespace where it’s less
        structured and relies more on atmosphere. Rather than large blank areas,
        the space is often filled with ambient visuals and floating elements,
        making it feel occupied all the time. There is also no central focus,
        like <a href="https://holdspace.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Holdspace</a>
        and the whitespace is empty, which is why the users are left in
        ambiguity.

      <h3>Mapping</h3>
      <article style="--custom_color: black">
      <p class="scrollPara">
        <article1 style="--custom_color: black">
        <a href="https://holdspace.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Holdspace</a>
        </article1>
        is very direct in its mapping since it only has one control, which is
        the space bar. There are no visible UI elements like buttons or sliders,
        since the shape and sound act as the real time feedback. Despite having
        only one input, the control manages multiple simultaneous variables such
        as shape, sound, motion, and size, which makes the experience very
        expressive and encourages immersion. However,
        <article1 style="--custom_color: black">
        <a href="https://fractalfantasy.net/#liquidentropy" target="_blank"
          >Liquid entropy</a
        >
        </article1>
        uses more traditional UI components such as sliders which allows users
        to adjust different controls to manipulate their audiovisual experience.
        Since every slider allows for the adjustment of different sensory
        variables, it helps make the mapping indirect. While the controls are
        clear, the system’s response can feel more ambiguous or interpretive
        which invites exploration and is designed to let users play however they
        like. Overall,
        <article1 style="--custom_color: black">
        <a href="https://holdspace.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Holdspace</a>
        </article1>
        shows how a single, familiar control can be mapped to a multisensory
        experience, giving a fixed response. However,
        <article1 style="--custom_color: black">
        <a href="https://fractalfantasy.net/#liquidentropy" target="_blank"
          >Liquid entropy</a

        </article1>
        uses traditional UI components and creates
        a space where users shape emotional and perceptual tone themselves
        rather than manipulating fixed outcomes. Despite their differing
        mappings, both websites succeed in communicating through interaction
        through careful synchronisation of audio, visuals, and motion.

      <h3>Characterisation</h3>
      <article style="--custom_color: black">
      <p class="scrollPara">
        In
        <a href="https://holdspace.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Holdspace</a>,
        characterisation emerges from the users familiarity with the beat,
        which causes rhythmic expansion, making the pentagon feel
        alive. This experience is caused by how fast the pentagon is moving and
        how it grows or shrinks based on volume, mimicking a pulse. This
        rhythmic pace creates a sense of spontaneity while subtly training users
        to associate volume and sound with movement. The tumbling and
        rumbling of the pentagon aligns with the beat, reinforcing users’
        expectations that the shape will grow on impact, further enhancing the
        feeling of movement in response to sound. When the user lets go of the
        spacebar, the pentagon collapses into a triangle, the music becomes
        quieter and higher-pitched, and movement ceases which clearly signals a
        change in state which allows the users to quickly learn that when the
        pentagon appears, they are in control and when the triangle appears, they are not,
        which sets this expectation. Similarly,
        <a href="https://fractalfantasy.net/#liquidentropy" target="_blank"
          >Liquid entropy</a
        >
        also relies on the familiarity that users have in movement and sound.
        However, the website does this by having a more continuous interaction
        where the visuals follow the cursor so it really feels like the sound is
        following them. Every time there is an upwards motion, the website
        responds with a higher pitch and the cursor follows the visuals, while
        a downward motion lowers the pitch and retreats the visuals. Overall,
        <a href="https://fractalfantasy.net/#liquidentropy" target="_blank"
          >Holdspace</a
        >
        feels like a rhythmic companion whilst
        <a href="https://fractalfantasy.net/#liquidentropy" target="_blank"
          >Liquid entropy</a
        >
        feels more malleable, constantly adapting to the user’s movements.

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p class="scrollPara">
        <article style="--custom_color: black">
        In <article1 style="--custom_color: black">
          <a href="https://holdspace.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Holdspace</a></article1>
          ,
        the feedback is binary and reactive; by letting the spacebar go, it
        instantly transforms the visual form from a still triangle to a dynamic,
        pulsing pentagon. This visual shift is paired with a change in audio
        where the beat becomes louder and more rhythmic, creating an immediate
        cause and effect relationship. The presence of a timer at the top also
        reinforces the idea of control, subtly guiding user behavior through
        visual cues. In contrast,
        <article1 style="--custom_color: black">
        <a href="https://fractalfantasy.net/#liquidentropy" target="_blank"
          >Liquid entropy</a
        ></article1>
        offers a more continuous, ambient feedback where users receive real time
        auditory and visual responses through sliders and cursor movement. As
        the user moves the cursor, the pitch and visuals adjust, which results
        in feedback that feels fluid rather than reactive. However, both
        websites have immediate feedback which is comforting for the user.
