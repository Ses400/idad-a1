      <h3>Information design</h3>
      <p class="scrollPara">
        <a href="https://holdspace.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Holdspace</a>
        uses minimal textual information and focuses on a single dynamic visual
        interaction instead, which is a 3d pentagon made of black outlines, that
        changes size and movement in response to sound. There's almost no
        instructions, which is to intentionally leave users to intuitively
        explore the relationship between sound and form to prioritise their
        embodied understanding over cognitive instruction. The overall UI is
        extremely minimalistic, using only black and white to contrast the
        background and guide the user to focus on different things. When the
        user is playing the music, there is a white background and the pentagon
        is specifically outlined in black, to draw the user’s attention
        immediately towards it. This whitespace amplifies the movement of the
        pentagon, making it become more dramatic and noticeable because there’s
        nothing competing with it. However, when the user stops, the background
        suddenly turns black, to almost mimic being sucked in since there is
        immediate visual contrast from the white and a pointy triangle
        resembling a shard, is left in its stead to make the user feel more
        unwelcomed. This encourages the user to continue their experience of the
        pentagon. Similarly, in
        <a href="https://fractalfantasy.net/#liquidentropy" target="_blank"
          >Liquid entropy</a
        >
        the entire page feels alive due to movement and sound, not text or
        buttons, making the aim of both websites to evoke a feeling from users.
        Since its visuals create a floating, ambient effect, matched with the
        visuals, the overall mood is dominant and evokes a more mysterious and
        atmospheric experience. However, liquid entropy takes a very different
        approach towards whitespace where it’s less structured and relies more
        on atmosphere. Rather than large blank areas, the space is often filled
        with ambient visuals, and floating elements making it occupied all the
        time. There is also no central focus which is why the users are left in
        ambiguity. This contrasts to holdspace where the whitespace was empty
        and there is a timer which signifies the length of the experience.

      <h3>Mapping</h3>
      <p class="scrollPara">
        <a
          href="https://webaudioapi.com/book/Web_Audio_API_Boris_Smus_html/ch03.html#s03_2"
          target="_blank"

        for a way to implement this using JavaScript maths objects. All of the
        audio tracks start playing in a loop once the interaction starts – the
        scrolling only changes the volume. Another potential implementation
        could pause the songs not currently part of the crossfade however in
        this case that might cause them to fall out of sync as they are all set
        to same bpm.
      </p>
      <h3>Characterisation</h3>
      <p class="scrollPara">
        There is a small amount of interaction required before a user is able to
        use the scrolling mix. There is an initial popup with some minimal
        information about the work and a warning about the download size it will
        use. Once a user continues they are greeted by a button with the text
        “expand to scroll” which once pressed will start the audio interaction
        and an animation displaying this text and expanding the page size to
        allow enough room to mix smoothly with scrolling. This animation is
        useful to set expectations of what will be on the total page and to
        encourage curiosity in the user who may want to read the text they have
        briefly glimpsed.
      </p>
      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p class="scrollPara">
        The coloured gradients on the page were implemented as a way to give
        additional visual feedback indicating roughly were the different tracks
        blend into one another. Each time the page loads a new gradient is
        generated randomly which a different band of colour added per track in
        the list. This random generation was done by using
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl"
          target="_blank"
          >HSL colour</a
        >
        values which allows more specific control over the kinds of colours
        generated as I can shift the hue using one number while maintaining a
        predefined saturation and lightness. This method also allows me to
        easily generate a colour of the “opposite” hue as can be seen providing
        the contrast between the inner box and the outer frame.
